# Constraints_on_convex_hull-
Here, we use an alternative method to determine the points where the hyperplane of a given constraint intercepts the facets of a convex hull. With the intercept points, we generate a new convex hull according to the constraint condition ("=", "<=" or ">="). The original convex hull is generated from a dataset using the Quickhull algorithm. We attach two examples, one of two dimensions and the other of four dimensions, to show how the codes can be used. 
We use these codes to apply optimization methods in specific regions of the domain of a data-driven model.
